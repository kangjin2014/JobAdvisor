is the opportunity  Study of threat landscape reveals that the number of cyber attacks has increased significantly over the past decade  Attackers are more sophisticated and better organized than any time before  and attacks are becoming more and more complex in nature  Traditional solutions  mostly based on signatures and predetermined rules  are therefore incapable of handling complex threat scenarios  Moreover  they lack required scalability and do not provide proper context and sufficient transparency into events and activities  which are essential for carrying out effective forensic activities  To overcome these challenges  the Cyber Security program at the RBC takes an alternative approach by leveraging advanced Machine Learning techniques and Big Data technologies to model and predict the behavior of users devices and extract actionable information from cyber security data  hence delivering Proactive Threat Detection and Response  What will you do  Work with fraud and cyber security experts and other Data Scientists to design and develop Machine Learning algorithms to identify high risk fraudulent transactions and complex threat scenarios  Build on the knowledge of threat models and attack trees (provided by subject matter experts) to analyze structured and unstructured data (e g  online banking transactions  network security devices  threat intelligence) and identify malicious patterns of behavior and misuse  Baseline user device behavior and identify anomalous activities  Enable the business to adopt and promote a proactive approach to fraud  cyber threat  and misuse identification  Participate in Proof of Concept or Proof of Technology projects to evaluate fraud detection and cyber security technologies and platforms  Operate third party technologies to analyze security data and identify threats and misuse cases  evaluating the capabilities of those technologies  Participate in the creation of detailed plans and accurate estimates
