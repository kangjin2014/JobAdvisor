# Job_Recommender

### How to Run?

1. Spin up a Flask web server running at port 5010, localhost. It will accept the resume from end users.

       $ chmod +x run_flask.sh
    
       $ ./run_flask.sh

2. Submit the resume

       open the address 'localhost:5010' in the browser
       
       submit the resume by pressing the 'submit' button. 

3. Run job matching
    
       $ python -m job_matching
