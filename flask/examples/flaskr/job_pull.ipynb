Here, the accuracy of 85% is achieved for prediction of collisions, which is quite significant in this model. This result reflects the dependency of collision with the previous collision with the time value. Also from the second model based on decision tree and random forest, it is observed that the severity of injury is clearly explained by variables. Under this model, I am able to identify the key factors related to the severity of injury leading to the injury classes like fatal, major, minimal, minor and none.\\xa0\\xa0Voluntary Retirement Prediction of Employees (Term Projects)\\xa0Ryerson University, Data Science Lab | Jan 2017 - April 2017\\xa0\\xa0Prediction of employee turnover in a company, which indicates how many employees are going to take voluntary retirement.
